As a chemistry M.Sc. candidate, I have the pleasure and privilege of mentoring undergraduate students. 
Currently, I am a laboratory teaching assistant for [**Chemistry 1302B:** *Discovering Chemical Energetics.*](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/undergraduate/current_students/course_information/index.html) In Fall of 2021, I was a teaching assistant for [**Chemistry 1301A:** *Discovering Chemical Structure.*](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/undergraduate/current_students/course_information/index.html)
Presently, I do not have any office hours and current students should contact the laboratory coordinator for all lab-related inquiries. If you are a former student of mine, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my undergraduate experiences.
