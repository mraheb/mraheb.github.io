As a M.Sc. candidate in chemistry, I have the pleasure and privilege of mentoring and teaching undergraduate students. 
Currently, I am not a teaching assistant for any courses. If you are a former student of mine and have any questions regarding my undergrad experience, feel free to [contact me](https://mraheb.github.io/contactme/) with your name, the year I instructed you, and the course you had me for. Thus far, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:

* Fall 2021: [**Chemistry 1301A**: Discovering Chemical Structure.](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/pdfs/undergraduate/docs/outlines/1301.pdf)
* Winter 2022: [**Chemistry 1302B**: Discovering Chemical Energetics.](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/pdfs/undergraduate/docs/outlines/1302.pdf)
* Summer 2022: [**Chemistry 2213A**: Organic Chemistry for the Life Sciences.](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/pdfs/undergraduate/docs/outlines/2213.pdf)
