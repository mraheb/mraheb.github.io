Hello there!
My name is Maria Raheb and I am a M.Sc. candidate at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/), in the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/graduate/index.html), specializing in the Physical and Analytical division, namely the Theoretical and Computational sector. I attained my B.Sc. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.uwo.ca/) and [Chemistry](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/) in 2021 at the University of Western Ontario, where I completed a senior project in theoretical mathematical biology under the supervision of [Dr. Lindi Wahl](https://publish.uwo.ca/~lwahl/). Presently, I am completing my masterâ€™s thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Viktor Staroverov](https://publish.uwo.ca/~vstarove/index.html) in quantum chemistry.
