Hello there!
My name is Maria Raheb and I am a M.Sc. candidate at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/), in the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/graduate/index.html), specializing in the Physical and Analytical division, namely the Theoretical and Computational sector. I attained my B.Sc. in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.uwo.ca/) and [Chemistry](https://www.uwo.ca/chem/) in 2021 at the University of Western Ontario, where I completed a senior project in theoretical mathematical biology under the supervision of [Dr. Lindi Wahl](https://publish.uwo.ca/~lwahl/). Presently, I am completing my master’s thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Viktor Staroverov](https://publish.uwo.ca/~vstarove/index.html) in computational quantum chemistry. 

Composers I enjoy listening to whilst computing include, but certainly not limited to, are [Sergei Rachmaninoff](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Kekt6CKSo0m5mivKcoH51?si=f_KrCXQOQiOPgLTAPAetYg), [Pyotr Tchaikovsky](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3MKCzCnpzw3TjUYs2v7vDA?si=0Q1OiFcgSVaGPrsYcEO7og), [Aram Khachaturian](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5WIoytpqi3VWoFSHnl49in?si=SBmdaDu8RYyuN7uCSGgJ6g), [Frédéric Chopin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7y97mc3bZRFXzT2szRM4L4?si=4e7ZZvC0R5eo4ura1qBbQw), [Sergei Prokfiev](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kHtgiRnpmFIV5Tm4BIs8l?si=Ctj-Toc1RQKp6-J3JdI7HA), [Johann Bach](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5aIqB5nVVvmFsvSdExz408?si=Lw4IxE96QI6FWMdpxQq_qg), and [Igor Stravinsky](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ie36YytMoKtPiL7tUvmoE?si=h3aGZoZZQxqsvCfqVhk69g). Modern composers I enjoy listening to, and frankly you should too, include, [Michael Giacchino](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4kLvhMAuCloLxoP1aVM7Lr?si=h-9yipyoQ2OEV8Yjo3aFmA), [John Williams](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3dRfiJ2650SZu6GbydcHNb?si=GxXJcTpkTEq-5T0W5HSYHQ), and [Danny Elfman](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5qBZETtyzfYnXOobDXbmcD?si=ffJAiL2ESviO35nPK0dCUA). When I'm not yelling obscenities at my computer screen, I enjoy hiking, reading, experimenting in the kitchen, singing out of tune, dancing out of beat, missing free throws, and taking pictures out of focus. I also find pleasure in discussing stoic philosophy, metaphysics, existentialism, epistemology and it's ties to politics and ethics. Biomimicry, world history, especially human migration patterns, evolution of humans and human thought, and space exploration fascinate me and will be discussed in future blog posts. You are more than welcome to reach out to me if you have any questions regarding my experiences or if you just want to chat; exposure to different points of view are always welcome!
