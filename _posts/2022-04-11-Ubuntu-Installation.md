Purchasing a new laptop can be exciting, but reinstalling applications and programs from your former laptop is a pain. Recently, I retired my ASUS Zenbook and upgraded to the [Lenovo IdeaPad 5](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/lenovo-ideapad-5-15-6-laptop-abyss-blue-amd-ryzen-7-5700u-512gb-ssd-16gb-ram-windows-11/15701037?cmp=seo-15701037&cmp=knc-s-71700000068294177&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI943xidet9wIVj21vBB2HvgKEEAQYASABEgI1LfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). This new laptop ticked all the boxes.
