1. "Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
    Don't stop, it'll soon be here
    It'll be better than before
    Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone."
- Don't Stop, Fleetwood Mac, 1977


2. "Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight
    What will be, will be."
-  You and I, Part II, Fleetwood Mac, 1987
