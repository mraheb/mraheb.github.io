Inspired by [Yuval Noah Harai's](https://www.ynharari.com/about/) wonderful text, [*21 Lessons for the 21st Century*](https://www.amazon.ca/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0771048882/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1356797581896216&hvadid=84800003692843&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=123984&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-84800019577937%3Aloc-32&hydadcr=10230_10408543&keywords=21+lessons+for+the+21st+century+by+yuval+noah+harari&qid=1652460161&sr=8-1), I have written 25 lessons (and motivational quotes) (axioms) I have learned thus far in my 25 years on this big blue marble-*music edition!*
    
  1.  <p>"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow<br>
          Don't stop, it'll soon be here<br>
          It'll be better than before<br>
          Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone."<br>
          <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>Don't Stop</b>, Fleetwood Mac, (1977)</em></span>
      </p>

  2.  <p>"Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight<br>
       What will be, will be."<br>
       <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>You and I, Part II</b>, Fleetwood Mac, (1987)</em></span>
       </p>

  3.  <p>"Still so many answers I don't know<br>
      Realize that to question is how we grow."<br>
      <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>Proud</b>, Heather Small, (2001)</em></span>
      </p>

  4.  <p>"I get up and nothin' gets me down<br>
      You got it tough, I've seen the toughest around<br>
      And I know, baby, just how you feel<br>
      You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real."<br>
      <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>Jump</b>, Van Halen, (1984)</em></span>
      </p>
    
   5.  <p>"Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
       Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
       Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
       Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
       So much to do, so much to see<br>
       So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
       You'll never know if you don't go<br>
       You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>
       Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
       Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
       And all that glitters is gold<br>
       Only shooting stars break the mold."<br>
       <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>All Star</b>, Smash Mouth, (1999)</em></span>
       </p>
       
   6.  <p>"I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky<br> 
       Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity<br>
       I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva<br>
       I'm gonna go, go, go<br>
       There's no stopping me."<br>
       <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>Don't Stop Me Now</b>, Queen, (1978)</em></span>
       </p>

  7.   <p>"Always had a fear of being typical<br>
        Looking at my body feeling miserable<br>
        Always hanging on to the visual<br>
        I wanna be invisible<br>
        Looking at my years like a martyrdom<br>
        Everybody needs to be a part of 'em<br>
        Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son<br>
        I was born to run, I was born for this."<br>
        <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em><b>Whatever it Takes</b>, Imagine Dragons, (2017)</em></span>
