Inspired by [Yuval Noah Harai's](https://www.ynharari.com/about/) wonderful text, [*21 Lessons for the 21st Century*](https://www.amazon.ca/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0771048882/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=1356797581896216&hvadid=84800003692843&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=123984&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvtargid=kwd-84800019577937%3Aloc-32&hydadcr=10230_10408543&keywords=21+lessons+for+the+21st+century+by+yuval+noah+harari&qid=1652460161&sr=8-1), I have written 25 lessons I have learned thus far in my 25 years on this big blue marble-*music edition!*

1. <p>"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow<br>
    Don't stop, it'll soon be here<br>
    It'll be better than before<br>
    Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone."<br>
    <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em>Don't Stop, Fleetwood Mac, 1977</em></span>
   </p>

2. <p>"Keep your heart open and your eyes shut tight<br>
    What will be, will be."<br>
    <span style = "color:#989d9e"><em>You and I, Part II, Fleetwood Mac, 1987</em></span>
    </p>
