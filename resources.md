## Chemistry Resources
Below one will find a plethora of texts that have helped me tremendously during my undergraduate career, especially with my chemistry major.  
### *resources for the curious computational chemist:*
1. [*Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics* by **Errol G. Lewars**](https://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Chemistry-Introduction-Applications-Molecular/dp/3319809156/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1644192255&sr=8-2)

### *resources for the quirky quantum chemist:*
1. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Ira N. Levine** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Ira-N-Levine/dp/9332558531/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3U72ICSKUBJII&keywords=ira+levine+quantum&qid=1644192949&sprefix=ira+levine+quantum%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-5)
This is a wonderful text for beginner and intermediate, undergraduate and graduate students alike. Levine's text is unique because it includes mathematical derivations for nearly all of the quantum mechanical models discussed in a gentle and palatable manner.


2. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Donald A. McQuarrie**](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Donald-McQuarrie/dp/8130918943/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HC19QPTJJ0G1&keywords=mcquarrie+quantum&qid=1644193062&sprefix=mcquarrie+quantum%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-3) This text is particularly intriguing to me, for its subheadings are rather unconventional when compared to its counterparts; each subheading in the text is a **single** statement summerizing the proceeding section, rather than a vague title of what the section will discuss. This is incredibly helpful if you want to review key concepts at a single glance. For instances, the subheading, *"The Schrodinger Equation for a Hydrogen Atom Can Be Solved Exactly,"* is far more insightful than, *"The Hydrogen Atom."*
