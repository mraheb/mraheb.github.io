## Chemistry Resources
Below one will find a plethora of chemistry texts that have helped me tremendously during my undergraduate career, especially with my chemistry major. The first three sections listed below continue to aid me in my graduate studies and hopefully they will be of use to you too.

### *resources for the curious computational chemist:*
1. [*Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics* by **Errol G. Lewars**](https://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Chemistry-Introduction-Applications-Molecular/dp/3319809156/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1644192255&sr=8-2) I used this text quite a bit for an undergraduate computational chemistry course years ago and its still of good use for my work today. The book is essentially a discussion of the three main computational techniques used in the field-- ab initio, semiempirical, and density functional-based calculations. Each section concludes with a series of *Easier Questions*, and *Harder Questions*, and solutions are available for the latter set of questions.

### *resources for the quirky quantum chemist:*
1. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Ira N. Levine** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Ira-N-Levine/dp/9332558531/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3U72ICSKUBJII&keywords=ira+levine+quantum&qid=1644192949&sprefix=ira+levine+quantum%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-5)
This is a wonderful text for beginner and intermediate, undergraduate and graduate students alike. Levine's text is unique because it includes mathematical derivations for nearly all of the quantum mechanical models discussed in a gentle and palatable manner.

2. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Donald A. McQuarrie**](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Donald-McQuarrie/dp/8130918943/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HC19QPTJJ0G1&keywords=mcquarrie+quantum&qid=1644193062&sprefix=mcquarrie+quantum%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-3) This text is particularly intriguing to me, for its subheadings are rather unconventional when compared to its counterparts; each subheading in the text is a **single** statement summerizing the proceeding section, rather than a vague title of what the section will discuss. This is incredibly helpful if you want to review key concepts at a single glance. For instances, the subheading, *"The Schrodinger Equation for a Hydrogen Atom Can Be Solved Exactly,"* is far more insightful than, *"The Hydrogen Atom."*

3. [*Molecular Quantum Mechanics* by **Peter Atkins and Ronald Friedman**](https://www.amazon.ca/Molecular-Quantum-Mechanics-Peter-Atkins/dp/0199541426/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KWFIOZ22ROX5&keywords=molecular+quantum+mechanics&qid=1644381245&sprefix=molecular+quantum+mechnaics%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-3)  This text is best suited for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students. For those who have an appreciation for group theory and its connection to quantum chemistry, this book dedicates an entire chapter on the subject and does not omit the mathematical rigor involved in really understanding symmetry in chemistry and its implications.
