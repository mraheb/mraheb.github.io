## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Chemistry Resources</span>
Below one will find a plethora of chemistry texts that have helped me tremendously during my undergraduate career, especially with my chemistry major. The texts listed under the first three sections below continue to aid me in my graduate studies and hopefully they will be of use to you too.

### resources for the curious computational chemist:
1. [*Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics by* **_Errol G. Lewars_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Chemistry-Introduction-Applications-Molecular/dp/3319809156/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1644192255&sr=8-2) 
I used this text quite a bit for an undergraduate computational chemistry course years ago and its still of good use for my work today. The book is essentially a discussion of the three main computational techniques used in the field-- ab initio, semiempirical, and density functional-based calculations. Each section concludes with a series of *Easier Questions*, and *Harder Questions*, and solutions are available for the latter set of questions.

### resources for the quirky quantum chemist:
1. [*Quantum Chemistry by* **_Ira N. Levine_** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Ira-N-Levine/dp/9332558531/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3U72ICSKUBJII&keywords=ira+levine+quantum&qid=1644192949&sprefix=ira+levine+quantum%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-5)
This is a wonderful text for beginner and intermediate, undergraduate and graduate students alike. Levine's text is unique because it includes mathematical derivations for nearly all of the quantum mechanical models discussed in a palatable manner.

2. [*Quantum Chemistry by* **_Donald A. McQuarrie_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Donald-McQuarrie/dp/8130918943/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HC19QPTJJ0G1&keywords=mcquarrie+quantum&qid=1644193062&sprefix=mcquarrie+quantum%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-3) This text intrigues me, for its subheadings are rather unconventional  compared to other quantum texts; each subheading in the text is a **single** statement summerizing the proceeding section, rather than a vague title of what the section will discuss. This is incredibly helpful if you want to review key concepts at a single glance. For instances, the subheading, *"The Schrodinger Equation for a Hydrogen Atom Can Be Solved Exactly,"* is far more insightful than, *"The Hydrogen Atom."*

3. [*Molecular Quantum Mechanics by* **_Peter Atkins and Ronald Friedman_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Molecular-Quantum-Mechanics-Peter-Atkins/dp/0199541426/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KWFIOZ22ROX5&keywords=molecular+quantum+mechanics&qid=1644381245&sprefix=molecular+quantum+mechnaics%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-3)  This text is best suited for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students. For those who have an appreciation for group theory and its connection to quantum chemistry, this book dedicates an entire chapter on the subject and does not omit the mathematical rigor involved in truly understanding symmetry in chemistry and its implications.

### resources for the passionate physical chemist:
1. [*Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Nanoscienc by* **_Ken A. Dill and Sarina Bromberg_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Molecular-Driving-Forces-Statistical-Thermodynamics/dp/0815344309/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=molecular+driving+forces&qid=1644635385&sprefix=molecular+driving+%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1)

2. [*Physical Chemistry by* **_Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula, and James Keeler_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Atkins-Physical-Chemistry-Peter/dp/0198769865/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2U928G185K2L9&keywords=atkins+physical+chemistry&qid=1644635498&sprefix=atkins+physical+chemistry%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1) This is a pretty good reference text suitable for intermediate students. A great feature of this text are the sections proceding each topic; before each topic is covered, 


### resources for the outstanding organic chemist:
1. [*Organic Chemistry by* **_David Klein_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Organic-Chemistry-David-R-Klein/dp/1119659590/ref=sr_1_7?crid=XRYENXYRXZGO&keywords=klein+organic&qid=1644634991&sprefix=klein+organic%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-7) This is a phenomenal introductory organic chemistry text for both chemistry and non-chemistry students alike. The first few chapters acquaint the reader with the concepts nescessary to establish a solid foundation in organic chemistry, (i.e. a review of general chemistry, acid-base chemistry, and stereochemistry). Thereafter, the text is organized by functional group, which makes navigating the text easier and frankly makes learning a subject like organic chemistry less daunting. For example, everything you need to know about alcohols is in one place, (nomenclature, physical and chemical properties, and reactivity).


3. [*Organic Chemistry by* **_Jonathan Clayden, Nick Greeves, and Stuart Warren_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden-ebook/dp/B00AFY2SQK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CS9PPB08EYIU&keywords=organic+chemistry+clayden&qid=1644635072&sprefix=organic+chemistry+clayde%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1) This text is best suited for intermediate-level students. For a more gentle introduction to organic chemistry, see above. Unlike Klein's text, Clayden's is organized by reaction type and loosely by reactivity, which makes navigating this text for a beginner or non-expert (like myself) a bit cumbersome.

3. [*Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis by* **_László Kürti and Barbara Czakó_** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Strategic-Applications-Reactions-Organic-Synthesis/dp/0124297854/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) This text is best suited for advanced chemistry students with an aptitude for organic chemistry or for those interested in enhancing their knowledge in organic chemistry. The text is essentially an extensive library of well-known reactions, their importance, mechanism, and synthetic applications.



### resources for the inquisitive inorganic chemist:
1. [*Inorganic Chemistry by* **_Gary Miessler_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Inorganic-Chemistry-5th-Gary-Miessler/dp/0321811054) I got substantial use out of this text for a transition metals chemistry course back in undergrad. Unlike other inorganic chemistry texts, Miessler discusses group theory and its ties to molecular orbital theory and spectroscopy a , so if you're keen on group theory and its implications in inorganic chemistry and spectroscopy, give this text a go! 

## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Applied Mathematics Resources</span>
Below this heading, one will find a collection of texts I used to supplement my lectures in applied mathematics. Similar to above, I have linked where these books can be purchased.

### dynamical systems-ordinary and partial differential equations:
1. [*Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Completely Solved Problems by* **_T. Hillen, L.E. Leonard, and H. Van Roessel_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Partial-Differential-Equations-Completely-Problems/dp/1525550241/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) This text does a wonderful job presenting the three main PDEs studied in the field, (i.e. heat, wave, and Laplace equations), and their properties. A spectacular feature of this text is the collection of exams at the end, complete with solutions! Table of contents for the latest edition can be viewed [here](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Partial_Differential_Equations.html?id=G_WaDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y).

2. [*Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, with Applications in Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering by* **_Steven H. Strogatz_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Nonlinear-Dynamics-and-Chaos/dp/1138329452/ref=sr_1_1?crid=15KIG3NWO9DII&keywords=strogatz&qid=1644800369&sprefix=strogatz%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1) There are very few texts dedicated to nonlinear ordinary differential equations and their implications in the physical and natural sciences, which is crucial if one is to appreciate the theories surrounding dynamical systems. Strogatz' text does exactly that and then some; nearly every section in the text is complete with a real-world example, from love fairs to using chaos to send secret messages! Such applications are not limited to the examples in the text-they are also included in the problems at the end of each section. The accompanying [student's solution manual](https://www.amazon.ca/Student-Solutions-Manual-Nonlinear-Dynamics/dp/0813350549/ref=pd_bxgy_img_1/134-0374577-6992025?pd_rd_w=dXorM&pf_rd_p=19eafb8a-881a-44bb-9725-85a79b8c53d4&pf_rd_r=6Y7NTA2BG4V4CE2WX71E&pd_rd_r=d511e647-f643-4477-b78b-6d041276241b&pd_rd_wg=RVYHd&pd_rd_i=0813350549&psc=1) is also available for purchase.

3. [*Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems by* **_Nakhle H. Asmar_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Partial-Differential-Equations-Boundary-Problems/dp/0486807371/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SATC4HJPPV37&keywords=partial+differential+asmar&qid=1644634804&sprefix=partial+differential+asmar%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1) This text is perhaps the most rigorous of all the partial differential equations texts I have come across. There is extensive discussion on transform methods, such as Fourier, Laplace, and even Hankel transforms, (albeit the discussion on Hankel transforms is short, it is seldom included in any PDEs texts). 


### linear algebra:
1. [*Linear Algebra by* **_Stephen Friedberg, Arnold Insel, and Lawrence Spence_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Linear-Algebra-5th-Stephen-Friedberg/dp/0134860241/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2893HQCNPRJNY&keywords=linear+algebra+insel&qid=1645316289&sprefix=linear+algebra+insel%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-1) Although this is perhaps the most rigorous of the linear alegbra texts listed, it still does a wonderful job neatly communicating key concepts, making this text suitable for both beginners and veterans alike. The proofs are presented in an easy to follow manner and there is a plentiful of examples to further solidfy the reader's knowledge.

2. [*Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction by* **_David Poole_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Linear-Algebra-Introduction-David-Poole/dp/1285463242/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2LZVKOTP39DVO&keywords=linear+algebra+poole&qid=1645317033&sprefix=linear+algebra+poole%2Caps%2C314&sr=8-1) This text is great for applied mathematicians and engineers, as it contains a plentiful of examples and applications in chemistry, statistics, physics and engineering, buisness and economics, computer science, and the natural sciences. Compared to the first item in this list of texts, Poole's text is application-based and less centered on proofs.

3. [*Contemporary Linear Algebra by* **_Howard Anton and Robert C. Busby_**](https://www.bookdepository.com/Contemporary-Linear-Algebra-Howard-Anton/9780471163626) I got extensive use out of this text for a first year course in linear algebra and from what I can recall, there is emphasis on row-reducing--I remember having to do alot of that to find the range and nullspace of a matrix; quite a tedious task. In terms of exercises, the text contains a good balance of application and proof-based practice problems.


### calculus:
1. [*Calculus: Early Transcendentals by* **_James Stewart, Daniel K. Clegg, and Saleem Watson_**](https://www.amazon.ca/Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-James-Stewart-dp-1337613924/dp/1337613924/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)

2. [*Calculus by **James Stewart, Daniel K. Clegg, and Saleem Watson**](https://www.amazon.ca/Calculus-James-Stewart-dp-1337624187/dp/1337624187/ref=dp_ob_image_bk)


### general applied mathematics:
1. [*How To Derive A Formula - Volume 1: Basic Analytical Skills And Methods For Physical Scientists by* **_Alexei A Kornyshev and Dominic J O' Lee_**](https://www.bookdepository.com/How-Derive-Formula-1-Basic-Analytical-Skills-Methods-For-Physical-Scientists-Alexei-Kornyshev/9781786346445) How do I even begin to describe such a wonderful text? This is a text worthy of sitting atop your desk, and not collecting dust in your bookshelf--it is an applied mathematician must-have. Read about it [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/197239/new-book-teach-anyone-derive-formula/?fbclid=IwAR3Gi-FbMCPmS05-u9hIEmSBUK4pLPyI0bYs2RMOdaktVfloYuWVYNPccqI)

2. [*Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering* by **K.F. Riley, M.P. Hobson, and S.J.Bence**](https://www.amazon.ca/Mathematical-Methods-Physics-Engineering-Comprehensive/dp/0521679710/ref=sr_1_1?crid=16352BJL1R5OQ&keywords=Mathematical+Methods+for+Physics+and+Engineering&qid=1645315329&sprefix=mathematical+methods+for+physics+and+engineering%2Caps%2C408&sr=8-1)
