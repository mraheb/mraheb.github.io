## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Chemistry Resources</span>
Below one will find a plethora of chemistry texts that have helped me tremendously during my undergraduate career, especially with my chemistry major. The texts listed under the first three sections below continue to aid me in my graduate studies and hopefully they will be of use to you too.

### resources for the curious computational chemist:
1. [*Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics* by **Errol G. Lewars**](https://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Chemistry-Introduction-Applications-Molecular/dp/3319809156/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1644192255&sr=8-2) I used this text quite a bit for an undergraduate computational chemistry course years ago and its still of good use for my work today. The book is essentially a discussion of the three main computational techniques used in the field-- ab initio, semiempirical, and density functional-based calculations. Each section concludes with a series of *Easier Questions*, and *Harder Questions*, and solutions are available for the latter set of questions.

### resources for the quirky quantum chemist:
1. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Ira N. Levine** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Ira-N-Levine/dp/9332558531/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3U72ICSKUBJII&keywords=ira+levine+quantum&qid=1644192949&sprefix=ira+levine+quantum%2Caps%2C70&sr=8-5)
This is a wonderful text for beginner and intermediate, undergraduate and graduate students alike. Levine's text is unique because it includes mathematical derivations for nearly all of the quantum mechanical models discussed in a gentle and palatable manner.

2. [*Quantum Chemistry* by **Donald A. McQuarrie**](https://www.amazon.ca/Quantum-Chemistry-Donald-McQuarrie/dp/8130918943/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1HC19QPTJJ0G1&keywords=mcquarrie+quantum&qid=1644193062&sprefix=mcquarrie+quantum%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-3) This text is particularly intriguing to me, for its subheadings are rather unconventional when compared to its counterpart quantum texts; each subheading in the text is a **single** statement summerizing the proceeding section, rather than a vague title of what the section will discuss. This is incredibly helpful if you want to review key concepts at a single glance. For instances, the subheading, *"The Schrodinger Equation for a Hydrogen Atom Can Be Solved Exactly,"* is far more insightful than, *"The Hydrogen Atom."*

3. [*Molecular Quantum Mechanics* by **Peter Atkins and Ronald Friedman**](https://www.amazon.ca/Molecular-Quantum-Mechanics-Peter-Atkins/dp/0199541426/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1KWFIOZ22ROX5&keywords=molecular+quantum+mechanics&qid=1644381245&sprefix=molecular+quantum+mechnaics%2Caps%2C85&sr=8-3)  This text is best suited for advanced undergraduate students and graduate students. For those who have an appreciation for group theory and its connection to quantum chemistry, this book dedicates an entire chapter on the subject and does not omit the mathematical rigor involved in really understanding symmetry in chemistry and its implications.

### resources for the passionate physical chemist:
1. [*Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Nanoscience* by **Ken A. Dill and Sarina Bromberg**](https://www.amazon.ca/Molecular-Driving-Forces-Statistical-Thermodynamics/dp/0815344309/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=molecular+driving+forces&qid=1644635385&sprefix=molecular+driving+%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1)

2. [*Physical Chemistry* by **Peter Atkins, Julio de Paula, and James Keeler**](https://www.amazon.ca/Atkins-Physical-Chemistry-Peter/dp/0198769865/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2U928G185K2L9&keywords=atkins+physical+chemistry&qid=1644635498&sprefix=atkins+physical+chemistry%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1)


### resources for the outstanding organic chemist:
1. [*Organic Chemistry* by **David Klein**](https://www.amazon.ca/Organic-Chemistry-David-R-Klein/dp/1119659590/ref=sr_1_7?crid=XRYENXYRXZGO&keywords=klein+organic&qid=1644634991&sprefix=klein+organic%2Caps%2C138&sr=8-7) This is a phenomenal introductory organic chemistry text for both chemistry and non-chemistry students alike. The first few chapters acquaint the reader with the concepts nescessary to establish a solid foundation in organic chemistry, (i.e. a review of general chemistry, acid-base chemistry, and stereochemistry). Thereafter, the text is organized by functional group, which makes navigating the text easier and frankly makes learning a subject like organic chemistry less daunting. For example, everything you need to know about alcohols is in one place, (nomenclature, physical and chemical properties, and reactivity).


3. [*Organic Chemistry* by **Jonathan Clayden, Nick Greeves, and Stuart Warren**](https://www.amazon.ca/Organic-Chemistry-Jonathan-Clayden-ebook/dp/B00AFY2SQK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2CS9PPB08EYIU&keywords=organic+chemistry+clayden&qid=1644635072&sprefix=organic+chemistry+clayde%2Caps%2C103&sr=8-1) This text is best suited for intermediate-level students. For a more gentle introduction to organic chemistry, see above. Unlike Klein's text, Clayden's is organized by reaction type and loosely by reactivity, which makes navigating this text for a beginner or non-expert (like myself) a bit cumbersome.

3. [*Strategic Applications of Named Reactions in Organic Synthesis* by **László Kürti and Barbara Czakó** ](https://www.amazon.ca/Strategic-Applications-Reactions-Organic-Synthesis/dp/0124297854/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)



### resources for the inquisitive inorganic chemist:
1. [*Inorganic Chemistry* by **Gary Miessler**](https://www.amazon.ca/Inorganic-Chemistry-5th-Gary-Miessler/dp/0321811054) I got substantial use out of this text for a transition metals chemistry course back in undergrad. Unlike other inorganic chemistry texts, Miessler's dedicates a chapter on group theory and its ties to molecular orbital theory and spectroscopy, so if you're keen on group theory and its implications in inorganic chemistry and spectroscopy, give this text a go! 

## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Applied Mathematics Resources</span>
Below this heading, one will find a collection of texts that I used to supplement my lectures in applied mathematics. Similar to above, I have linked where these books can be purchased (Canadian websites).

### dynamical systems-ordinary and partial differential equations:
1. [*Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Completely Solved Problems* by **T. Hillen, L.E. Leonard, and H. Van Roessel**](https://www.amazon.ca/Partial-Differential-Equations-Completely-Problems/dp/1525550241/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) This text does a wonderful job presenting the three main PDEs studied in the field, (i.e. heat, wave, and Laplace equations), and their properties. A spectacular feature of this text is the collection of exams at the end, complete with solutions! Table of contents for the latest edition can be viewed [here](https://books.google.ca/books/about/Partial_Differential_Equations.html?id=G_WaDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y).

2. [*Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, with Applications in Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering* by **Steven H. Strogatz**](https://www.amazon.ca/Nonlinear-Dynamics-and-Chaos/dp/1138329452/ref=sr_1_1?crid=15KIG3NWO9DII&keywords=strogatz&qid=1644800369&sprefix=strogatz%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1) There are very few texts dedicated to nonlinear ordinary differential equations and their implications in the physical and natural sciences, which is crucial if one is to appreciate the theories surrounding dynamical systems. Strogatz' text does exactly that and then some; nearly every section in the text is complete with a real-world example, from love fairs to using chaos to send secret messages! Such applications are not limited to the examples in the text-they are also included in the problems at the end of each section. The accompanying [student's solution manual](https://www.amazon.ca/Student-Solutions-Manual-Nonlinear-Dynamics/dp/0813350549/ref=pd_bxgy_img_1/134-0374577-6992025?pd_rd_w=dXorM&pf_rd_p=19eafb8a-881a-44bb-9725-85a79b8c53d4&pf_rd_r=6Y7NTA2BG4V4CE2WX71E&pd_rd_r=d511e647-f643-4477-b78b-6d041276241b&pd_rd_wg=RVYHd&pd_rd_i=0813350549&psc=1) is also available for purchase.

3. [*Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems* by **Nakhle H. Asmar**](https://www.amazon.ca/Partial-Differential-Equations-Boundary-Problems/dp/0486807371/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SATC4HJPPV37&keywords=partial+differential+asmar&qid=1644634804&sprefix=partial+differential+asmar%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1) This text is perhaps the most rigorous of all the partial differential equations texts I have come across. There is extensive discussion on transform methods, such as Fourier, Laplace, and even Hankel transforms, (albeit the discussion on Hankel transforms is short, it is seldom included in any PDEs texts).
