## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Ongoing Projects</span>
* My group members and I (they don't know this yet), are actively working to compile solutions for the first four chapters of [*Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory* by **Attila Szabo and Neil S. Ostlund**](https://www.amazon.ca/Modern-Quantum-Chemistry-Introduction-Electronic/dp/0486691861/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2P59B0I98CA7H&keywords=szabo+quantum&qid=1645408717&sprefix=szabo+quantum%2Caps%2C72&sr=8-1).
