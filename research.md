<span style = "color:#55DBCD">*"True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving"- [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/)* </span>

## <span style = "color:#28bdad">What I do</span>
### <span style = "color:#28bdad">The Gist of my Work</span>
The thrust of my work as an M.Sc student is on generating Kohn-Sham potentials for chemical systems exhibiting considerable to significant multireference character.

### <span style = "color:#28bdad">For the Lay Audience</span>
#### <span style = "color:#28bdad">Classical Mechanics vs. Quantum Mechanics</span>
Let's start with something more tangible and relatable. Loosely speaking, **_classical mechanics_** is the study of the motion or behavior of **_macroscopic_** bodies (i.e. large objects), such as planets, desks, books, humans, to name a few. Unfortunately, classical mechanics fails miserably to explain the behavior of **_microscopic_** bodies (i.e. subatomic particles), such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, the latter being the most important to my research and are my favorite microscopic particle. People have favorite microscopic particles, right? Anyways, how do we remedy this problem? Does it even matter if we do? The answers to both questions are **_quantum mechanics_** and it absolutely does matter. The behavior of microscopic particles is governed by quantum mechanics, much like how the behavior of macroscopic particles is governed by classical mechanics. Consider an object of mass, $$m$$, traveling along a wire, (let's confine the mass' movement to one-dimension, say along the $$x$$-axis). Part of the classical mechanical regime is to determine the position, $$x$$, of the particle at any given time, $$t$$, that is we'd like to know $$x(t)$$. Once we know $$x(t)$$, we get access to some *goodies*, like the velocity, $$v= \frac{dx}{dt}$$, momentum, $$p=mv$$, the kinetic energy, $$T=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$, and other dynamical quanities of the object.

#### <span style = "color:#28bdad">The Wavefunction</span>
The key entity in quantum mechanics is the **_wavefunction_**, from which we can attain all the information, or *goodies* about the system of interest. The wavefunction is an enigmatic entity, that is, its quite difficult to conceptualize. However, Dr. Chris Cramer cleverly describes the wavefunction as being an oracle that you ask questions to by means of probing it with a so-called **_operator_**. Most often we are interested in the total energy of the system of interest and it can be obtained by probing the wavefunction with the **_Hamiltonian operator._** This operator is a sum of the kinetic energy operator and potential energy operator, where the latter characterizes the system and the former is the same for *every* system (more on this later). Now that we've introduced the wavefunction and the Hamiltonian operator, we're ready to introduce the **_Schrodinger equation,_** the most central equation of quantum mechanics, give in \eqref{eqn1}. 


\begin{equation}
\label{eqn1}
\boxed{\hat{H}\psi=E\psi} 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\hat{H}= -\frac{\hbar}{2m}\nabla^2+V} 
\end{equation}

### <span style = "color:#28bdad">*Versatility*</span>
As my third year quantum chemistry professor remarked, "mathematics is the language of all science;" indeed it is. Quantum chemistry is the *perfect* marriage of applied mathematics and chemistry. Quantum chemistry, namely computational quantum chemistry forms the basis for all other areas of chemistry.

## <span style = "color:#28bdad">Research Tips</span>
Much of my approach to research and discovery is owed to my wonderful supervisor. 
1. <span style = "color:#28bdad">*Tackle what's already known and established:*</span>
Start by reproducing the results of a paper pertaining to your research question. This is an excellent way to identify any issues you may have in understanding the underlying theory governing the problem you're interested in solving. Moreover, you'll be able to check if your results are correct because they've already been established by someone else!
2. <span style = "color:#28bdad">*The Low-hanging Fruit:*</span>
Once you have sucessfully reproduced the results of a pertinent paper, begin exploring the **simplest** of examples pertaining to your work, the low-hanging fruit. This is something I did quite alot of this in undergrad, especially in my mathematics courses; for instances, if you're asked to consider a model consisting of 10 variables, why not consider the same model but with 2 variables?
